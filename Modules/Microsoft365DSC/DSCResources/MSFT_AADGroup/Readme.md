# AADGroup

## Description

This resource configures an Azure Active Directory group. IMPORTANT: It does not support mail enabled security groups or mail enabled groups that are not unified or dynamic groups.
It is also possible to ensure that the group has one or more members. Be aware that this can create a conflict if member-users are also configured with MemberOf. See AADUser.
